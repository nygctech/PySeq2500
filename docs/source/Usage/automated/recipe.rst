Method Recipe
*************
There are 8 basic actions to build a recipe.

1. **PORT**: *port name* (string)
=================================

 Valve switches to specified port.
 ::

    PORT: water

2. **PUMP**: *pump volume in uL* (integer)
==========================================

 Syringe pump draws specified volume through flowcell lane.
 ::

    PUMP: 2000

3. **TEMP**: *temperature in degrees Celsius* (float)
=====================================================

 Set temperature of flowcell.
 ::

    TEMP: 55.0

4. **HOLD**: *hold time in min.* (integer)
==========================================

 Recipe pauses for specified time. The recipe can also be paused until user
 input by using `STOP` instead of an integer.
 ::

    HOLD: 10

5. **WAIT**: **IMAG** or `port name` (string)
=============================================

 Recipe waits to continue until the other flowcell is imaging (**IMAG**) or
 switches to *port name*. If there is only one flowcell, **WAIT** is ignored.
 ::

    WAIT: water

6. **IMAG**: *z focal planes* (integer)
=======================================

 The flowcell is imaged at the specified number of z focal planes at the
 sections listed in the experiment config.
 ::

    IMAG: 15

7. **EXPO**: *n times* (integer)
=======================================

 The flowcell is exposed with light a specified number times at the
 sections listed in the experiment config.
 ::

    EXPO: 10

8. **USER**: *user message* (string)
=======================================

 Recipe pauses for flowcell until the user confirms the message.
 ::

    USER: Add Reagent A to Port 1

Example Recipe
==============

 This recipe automates a method called 4i. In the 4i :ref:`method config<Method
 Config>` the :ref:`variable reagents<[cycles]>` and :ref:`first port<[method]>`
 are set as follows:

 ::

    variable reagents = 1stab, 2ndab
    first port = blocking

 The 4i method stains tissue sections by first blocking sections for 1 hr, then
 staining sections with 1stab, followed by 2ndab for 2 hrs. After the sections
 are imaged in imaging buffer, antibodies are eluted off the tissue sections, and
 are then ready for subsequent rounds of staining.
